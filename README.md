# Interactive Pulmonary Infarction Detection Survey

Interactive survey for the detection of infarction in pulmonary thromboembolism with chest X-ray in grayscale, pseudo color with 3D representation and its correlation with CT.

## Description

This project is an HTML-based interactive survey tool that allows users to classify chest X-ray images into categories such as Normal, Suspected Pulmonary Infarction, and Not Evaluable. The survey collects user demographic information and sends responses to a Google Sheets spreadsheet via a Google Apps Script Web App.

## Usage

- Open the survey HTML file in a modern browser.
- Fill in the demographic data (country, years of profession, specialty).
- Classify each image shown.
- Submit the answers; results will be sent to Google Sheets.
- Download the survey results as CSV if desired.

## Requirements

- The Google Apps Script Web App must be deployed and publicly accessible.
- The HTML file can be served from any HTTP(S) server or opened directly, but hosting on a web server (e.g., GitHub Pages) is recommended to avoid CORS issues.
